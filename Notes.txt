Understand Actor Pattern:

1. Reliable actors API provides as asynchronous, single threaded programming model using actors ????

2. Model enables to mimic singleton and single threaded implementation

Actor encapsulates certain states and behaviours.

Actor can be Statefull  or stateless actor  --> State of an actor is managed actor state provider, which can save state to either memory on disk or external storage

Lifetime of an actor:

Actors are virtual. When Actor is needed, actor proxy is used to send a message to it. Service fabric will activate the actor if it hasnt been activated or it is deactivated. 

*Concurrency 

	-- Service Fabric guarentees only one method is called at any given time
	-- Actor provide a turn based concurrency mode 
	-- when a method is executing, new requests will wait asynchronously for the lock until they can aquire the actor-level lock.
	-- The actor level lock is released only when the running method returns and the returned task completes.
	-- if a method doesnt modify state, it can be marked readonly
	-- Actors allow reentry by default i.e. if actor a calls actor b which inturn calls actor a it is allowed as it is single logical call chain context.
	-- you can mark an actor not to allow reentrancy
